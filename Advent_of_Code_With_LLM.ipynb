    "#### General Approach\n",
    "To solve this part of the problem, we will:\n",
    "1. Update the `is_safe` function to check if a report is safe without removing any levels.\n",
    "2. Create a new function `is_safe_with_dampener` that checks if a report can be made safe by removing a single level using the Problem Dampener.\n",

    "4. If we find a level that, when removed, makes the report safe, we consider the original report as safe.\n",
    "5. Update the `count_safe_reports` function to use `is_safe_with_dampener` instead of `is_safe` to count the safe reports.\n",

    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `calculate_sum_of_enabled_multiplications` function uses regular expressions to find all `mul`, `do()`, and `don't()` instructions in the corrupted memory.\n",
    "2. It keeps track of whether `mul` instructions are currently enabled or disabled using a boolean flag `mul_enabled`.\n",
    "3. The function iterates over all `mul` instructions and checks if a `do()` or `don't()` instruction occurs before the current `mul` instruction.\n",
    "4. If a `do()` instruction occurs before the current `mul` instruction, it enables `mul` instructions. If a `don't()` instruction occurs before the current `mul` instruction, it disables `mul` instructions.\n",
    "5. The function only processes `mul` instructions when they are enabled.\n",
    "6. The `main` function calls the `parse_input` and `calculate_sum_of_enabled_multiplications` functions and prints the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the solution, save the Python code to a file (e.g., `solution.py`) and run it using Python (e.g., `python solution.py`). Make sure the `input.txt` file is in the same directory as the Python script. The script will print the sum of the results of all enabled `mul` instructions in the corrupted memory."

    "\n",
    "**response**: The issue with the code is that it's not correctly checking the positions of the `do()` and `don't()` instructions. It should be checking if the current `mul` instruction is after a `do()` or `don't()` instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code first gets all positions of `do()` and `don't()` instructions. Then, for each `mul` instruction, it checks if the last instruction before it is a `do()` or `don't()`. If it's a `do()`, it enables `mul` instructions. If it's a `don't()`, it disables `mul` instructions. If there are no `do()` or `don't()` instructions before the `mul` instruction, it defaults to enabled. If a `do()` instruction comes after a `don't()` instruction, the `mul` instruction is enabled. If a `don't()` instruction comes after a `do()` instruction, the `mul` instruction is disabled.\n"

    "This Python solution defines two main functions: `read_input` for reading and parsing the input from the file, and `count_xmas` for counting the occurrences of X-MAS in the input grid considering all possible orientations and positions.\n",
